function p = holm_bonferroni(pvals, alpha)
% Finds the holm-bonferroni corrected pval for a group of unsorted pvals.
% See wikipedia page on this topic.
%
% Algorithm first sorts all Pvals from lowest to highest, and for each
% p-val tests whether it is lower than the Bonferroni corrected value for
% the remaining number of tests. Keeps repeating this until it finds a test
% that fails. This then is the returned corrected p-value.
%
% By default, alpha = 0.05
if nargin < 2
    alpha = 0.05
